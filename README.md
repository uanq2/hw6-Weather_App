I used a third-party API to develop a weather application that retrieves weather data of any city in the world. It stores past city searches.  
This is a responsive site that runs in the browser. The structure of the page features dynamically HTML and CSS.

This link is where the repo resides https://github.com/uanq2/hw6-Weather_App.git
This is the deployed application https://uanq2.github.io/hw6-Weather_App/
